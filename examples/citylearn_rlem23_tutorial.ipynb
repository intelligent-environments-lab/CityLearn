Electrification of end-uses, as well as decarbonizing the electrical grid through renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, constitutes a pathway to zero-emission buildings ([Leibowicz et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.046)). However, electrifying fossil-fueled building end-uses in fact could increase the demand on the existing electricity power grid and if power generation sources are not decarbonized at a similar rate as electrification happening on the demand side, will in fact result in adverse effects of increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Also, new grid infrastructure constitutes a significant capital investment and requires extensive planning and execution.\n",

        "Through distributed energy resources (DERs), buildings can provide flexibility services to the existing grid infrastructure in demand response events. On-site solar photovoltaic (PV) systems can also reduce dependence on the grid through self-generation. Yet, the intermittency of renewable energy sources introduces additional challenges of grid instability due to a mismatch between electricity generation (supply) and demand ([Suberu et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2014.04.009)). The California duck-curve is a good illustration of the mismatch in renewable supply and demand, and shows the effect of increased PV penetration that may lead to high ramp rate after the sun sets in the evening which the electric power grid may not be able to handle ([Denholm et al., 2008](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42305.pdf)).\n",

        "\n",
        "As buildings become electrified and the penetration of renewable energy source increases, a smart approach to manage and control building loads to ensure that these developments do not bring about grid insecurity is needed. The Department of Energy (DOE), introduced the __Grid-Interactive Efficient Building (GEB)__ Initiative to promote the integration of distributed energy resources (DERS) such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, electric vehicles (EVs), active and passive storage systems e.g. batteries, thermal storage tanks and thermal mass (walls) in buildings that can provide the grid with energy flexibility. A GEB is defined by [Neukomm et al., 2019](https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/pdfs/75470.pdf)] as:\n",

        "The energy efficiency of GEBs by means of tighter envelopes and high-quality construction that minimize heat losses lead to reduced loads without the need to make changes to a building's function or for changes in occupant preferences. PV adoption in GEBs provides self-generation capabilities which reduce the net load (difference between building end-use load and renewable energy generation) that will otherwise be satisfied by the electric grid alone. To then solve the duck curve problem that is introduced by renewable power generation, GEBs are able to shed and/or shift their loads. In load shedding, GEBs reduce their electricity use for a short time period and typically on short notice during peak demand periods. Load shifting in GEBs entails intentional and planned change in the timing of electricity use to reduce the demand on the grid during typical peak periods. Load shifting helps take advantage of cheaper and cleaner electricity. Load shedding  an result in shifting the shedded load.\n",

Smart controls can adapt to changes in occupant behavior, weather conditions or respond to external signals e.g. temperature set-point as in the case of demand-response, while maintaining energy efficiency and without causing discomfort to occupants. This adaptability is often referred to as __energy flexibility__ of a building ([Jensen et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.044))."

        "## Control Theories for Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings\n",
        "Rule-based control (RBC) is a popular control theory for building energy management. It makes use of simple if-else statements in their decision making process e.g. \"if outdoor dry-bulb temperature is < 20<sup>o</sup>C and hour is 10 PM, charge battery by 5% of its capacity\". Advanced control systems such as model predictive control (MPC) ([Drgona et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2020.09.001)) and reinforcement learning control (RLC) ([Wang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115036)) can be a major driver for executing grid services by automating the operation of energy systems, while adapting to individual characteristics of occupants and buildings. Comparatively, RBC and RLC are inexpensive to implement as they have a lower entry bar for domain knowledge of the systems to be controlled. RBC and vanilla RLC may perform sub-optimally compared to MPC as they are not modeled after the system under control although there exists a branch of RLC that includes a model of the controlled system. However, RLC is a data-driven solution and as more training data become available, it _learns_ the model of the building or system under control and achieves comparable performance as MPC. The greatest strength of RLC is its ability to adapt to changes in the system or building it controls as the dynamics e.g. thermal, occupancy change. We provide more context on reinforcement learning in the following section."

        "Machine learning techniques are generally characterized as either supervised or unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, the observations, otherwise called samples, and their response, otherwise called target are known when training the model. Supervised learning is further classified into regression and classification models where the former learns to predict a continuous variable and the latter learns to predict a discrete class. The supervised machine learning model must then learn the mapping of samples and targets by minimizing a loss function that evaluates the error between predicted targets and actual targets. An example of regression modelling in the context of GEBs is the prediction of a building's electricity consumption (target) when the the weather conditions e.g. dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity, as well as their associated timestamps (samples) are known. An example of a classification model in the context of GEBs is the prediction of a binary variable such as if building is \"occupied\" or \"not occupied\" (target) given the same samples as the regression example. It so happens that these kinds of problems are common in the building energy domain where predicting a building's electricity consumption and occupancy can help with scheduling and occupant-centric control to balance energy efficiency and comfort.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning on the other hand differs from supervised learning in the sense that the associated targets for the samples are unknown but models can be used to find common patterns amongst samples. This is important especially in exploratory data analysis to draw preliminary conclusions about a new dataset, and in situations where the class labels are unknown. An unsupervised model can then be used to infer data-driven class labels that can be used as targets in supervised classification models. An example of such application in buildings is the classification of customer load profiles to determine and allocate appropriate tariff plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "RL is similar to both supervised and unsupervised learning such that it follows the same idea of learning from observations. However in contrast to supervised learning, there are no known labeled targets. Instead, a model (agent/controller) influences the targets by acting in an environment that rewards actions that have desirable outcomes but penalizes those that lead to adverse outcomes. An example of RL in GEBs is charging/discharging of a battery (action) every hour (control time step) with the objective of minimizing the sum of electricity consumption of a building over a control horizon e.g. a year, given the same sample variables in the supervised learning example (observations). These actions affect the hourly electricity consumption of the building (reward). RL is thought of as a trial an error approach because typically, the agent starts off with no prior knowledge of the environment it acts in but learns from experience to associate observations with actions that maximize its rewards. The association is called a control policy.\n",

In a centralized control strategy, one agent manages the energy storage systems (ESSs) in the entire district whereas in a decentralized control strategy a one-controller-to-one-building approach is taken such that an independent controller manages the ESSs in a specific building. In the centralized control strategy, the controller receives district-level observations that may include individual building observations e.g. a building's net electricity consumption as well as observations taht are common in all buildings e.g. hour of the day. The central controller then prescribes actions for each building's ESSs. In the decentralized control strategy, each agent receives observations and returns actions for one building. The agents in the decentralized strategy may however choose to share information to achieve cooperative or competitive objectives. An example of a decentralized strategy with information sharing is the [MARLISA algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1145/3408308.3427604) developed in tandem with CityLearn."

        "1. We want to use a subset of the buildings so that we are not overwhelmed by the amount of data to analyze during the tutorial 🙂. Since CityLearn is primarily designed for district level energy management and coordination we should use more than 1 building, although a 1-building environment is possible. An considerable building count for tutoring purposes is 2-3.\n",
        "2. We want to use only a one-week period from the entire one-year period for this tutorial for the same reason of ease of analysis.\n",
        "3. Instead of using the [full observation space](https://www.citylearn.net/overview/observations.html) that will take a while to explore and converge in RL implementations, we will narrow down the space to only one observations: `hour`. This is not the best set up because the hour alone does not explain the state transitions in the environment that the agent is observing, nevertheless, it will help highlight the strengths and weaknesses of different control algorithms.\n",
        "4. CityLearn allows for two control strategies: centralized and decentralized as earlier discussed. In this tutorial we will make use of the former.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will make these modifications directly in the schema. To keep things interesting, the buildings and one-week period will be pseudo-randomly selected but for reproducibility, we will set the random generator seed. This seed can be changed to any value to select another pseudorandom set of buildings and time period. Also, we will provide a method to set the observations we want to use in our simulations so that later down the line, it will be easy to switch and utilize other observations.

        "We will start simple with a rule-based control (RBC) agent that you will build yourself_! RBC is a popular control strategy that is used in most systems e.g. HVAC, batteries, etc because of their level of simplicity. They are  best described as a set of rules expressed as if-else statements and conditions that guide their decision making. An example of such statement is `if outdoor dry-bulb temperature is 20 degrees Celcius and hour 10 PM, charge battery with 5% of capacity`. Now the actual implementation of this statement is open-ended as a designer can choose to program it using any programming language e.g. Python (as used in CityLearn) or a proprietary language that the battery manufacturer uses. Nevertheless, at a high-level, it simplifies to a set of statements and conditions that are easily understood and mappable (think decision tree in supervised learning).\n",
        "\n",
        "The RBC you will be designing here, is a set of if-else statements that use the `hour` observation to determine the amount of energy to charge or discharge a battery. Remember we are using a centralized control strategy thus, the if-else statements you define will apply to all batteries in all buildings.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use widgets for an interactive RBC tuning experience. You will design a custom RBC that inherits from an existing RBC in CityLearn called the [HourRBC](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.agents.rbc.html#citylearn.agents.rbc.HourRBC). Inheritance, allows us to copy existing properties and methods in the parent class, `HourRBC`, into our custom class. The `HourRBC` class allows one to define a custom `action_map` using the `hour` as the if condition and the battery capacity proportion as the action where negative proportions imply discharging and positive proportions imply charging.\n",

This balancing allows the agent to avoid local minima (exploration), while striving towards convergence (exploitation).

        "CityLearn has a Tabular Q-learning implementation in its `citylearn.agents.q_learning.TabularQLearning` class (see [docs](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.agents.base.html#citylearn.agents.q_learning.TabularQLearning)). This Q-Learning implementation is inspired by the [BOPTEST Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WeA_3PQeySba0MMRRte_oZTF7ptlP_Ra#scrollTo=9U81QUVcUfoW&line=17&uniqifier=1) but follows the general algorithm in the literature that we have described. However, a caveat of making use of this agent is that it requires discrete observations and actions in order to update the Q-Table whereas the default CityLearn environment provides continuous observations and actions.\n",

All we need to do is define the number of bins to use to discretize the observations and actions using the wrapper's `observation_bin_sizes` and `action_bin_sizes` initialization variables.\n",

        "The figures plotted for the Tabular Q-Learning are compared against the baseline and your tuned RBC. The Q-Learning agent has performed worse than the baseline and RBC in terms of the building-level and district-level KPIs. The net electricity consumption profile as a result of the Q-Learning agent shows unstable and spiky consumption. The reason for this behavior is seen in the battery SoC curves where the changes in SoC are abrupt. This highlights an issue with our discretized action space having too large steps as trade off for maintaining a reasonably-sized Q-Table. We also see that the agent did not learn the unique day-to-day building needs as the SoC profile is identical every 24 time steps. This is a consequence of using a single observation, hour to learn.\n",

        "Tabular Q-Learning is affected by the curse of dimensionality: as the size of the state space increases due to, e.g., continuous sensor inputs, the size of the Q-table has to necessarily increase is well. In particular for building control, the curse of dimensionality is significant, considering the potentially large number of sensors measuring various quantities (temperature, humidity, energy consumption, etc.) continuously. This means that the agent has an exponentially increasing number of state-action pairs to explore before it can converge to an optimal solution. Function approximators, e.g., linear regression or artificial neural networks ([Haykin (2009)](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/neural-networks-and-learning-machines/P200000003278/9780133002553)), have been proposed as solutions that allow generalization by directly mapping the state-action pairs, $(s, a)$, to their respective Q-value, $Q(s, a)$.

Actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) methods use artificial neural networks to generalize across the state-action space.

So, we can take advantage of self-generation in the late morning to late afternoon to charge for free and discharge the rest of the day thus reducing electricity consumption, cost and emissions at the very least.

The Tabular Q-Learning agent has the potential to adapt to unique building properties but suffers from the curse of dimensionality affecting its convergence to an optimal solution for the battery management. We also find that the SAC agent is sensitive to the reward function design and with a custom reward that is tailored towards achieving our evaluation KPIs, we can achieve a performance that is better than the baseline case and potentially better than an averagely tuned RBC.\n",

        "- Rerun the entire tutorial with a new [RANDOM_SEED](#scrollTo=vfnO0QBszXcS&line=1&uniqifier=1), [number of buildings](#scrollTo=6C6S46xmz50t&line=2&uniqifier=1) (between 1 - 15), [number of days](#scrollTo=6C6S46xmz50t&line=5&uniqifier=1) (1 - 365) and/or [observations](#scrollTo=6C6S46xmz50t&line=8&uniqifier=1). Remember to [set the number of discretization bins](#scrollTo=_6HotiSW4Pe8&line=2&uniqifier=1) for Tabular Q-Learning if you use other observations in your simulations.\n",
        "- How does the Tabular Q-Learning agent perform with a different set of hyperparameters and/or active observations?\n",
        "- How well does the Tabular Q-Learning learn if we use the custom reward function we defined? Are there any improvements compared to the original reward function?\n",
        "- Try to train the SAC agent on all the buildings and the full one-year period in the `citylearn_challenge_2022_phase_all` dataset.\n",
        "- Can you still improve some KPIs without self-generation in the buildings i.e. no photovoltaic (PV) system?\n",
        "- In our hand-on experiments here, we trained and tested on the same days. In reality, when an RL agent is deployed, it may experience states and state transitions that were not seen during training. Try to evaluate your trained agent on a different sequence of days and see if your trained agent generalizes well.\n",

        "- Bring your own dataset to CityLearn!\n",
