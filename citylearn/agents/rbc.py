    Parameters
    ----------
    env: CityLearnEnv
        CityLearn environment.
    action_map: Union[Mapping[int, float], Mapping[str, Mapping[int, float]], List[Mapping[str, Mapping[int, float]]]], optional
        A 24-hour action map for each controlled device where the key is the hour between 1-24 and the value is the action.
        For storage systems, the value is negative for discharge and positive for charge where it ranges between [0, 1]. 
        Whereas, for cooling or heating devices, the value is positive for proportion of nominal power to make available and 
        ranges between [0, 1]. The action map can be parsed as a dictionary of hour keys mapped to action values 
        (:code:`Mapping[int, float]`). Alternatively, it can be parsed as a dictionary of devices 
        (:code:`Mapping[str, Mapping[int, float]]`) with their specific hour key to action value mapping 
        (:code:`Mapping[int, float]`). Finally, the action map can be defined for each agent especially in decentralized 
        setup as a list of device dictionary where each device dictionary (:code:`Mapping[str, Mapping[int, float]]`) 
        is for a specific decentralized (or centralized) agent. The HourRBC will return random actions if no map is provided.
