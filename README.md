# CityLearn

CityLearn is an open-source Gymnasium environment for building energy coordination, demand response and reinforcement learning. Use it to configure renewable energy communities, run controllers and compare energy, cost and service outcomes.

CityLearn v3 brings together buildings and thermal systems, PV, batteries, EVs and flexible loads with electrical limits, local energy sharing, changing members and assets, and data or equipment failures. It builds on the CityLearn community's work and the extensions developed by the Soft-CPS Research Group.

## Install

```console
python -m pip install citylearn
```

Use Python 3.9 or newer in a virtual environment. See the [installation guide](https://www.citylearn.net/installation.html) for setup and optional dependencies, including Parquet support.

## Configure your community

The figure illustrates community configurations and services available in CityLearn. Individual scenarios can use different time resolutions; synchronized multi-community runs use a common timestep.

## Run your first simulation

This example downloads a public dataset on first use, runs a short episode with the built-in business-as-usual controller and prints community KPIs. It works outside a repository checkout.

```python
from citylearn.agents.baseline import BusinessAsUsualAgent
from citylearn.citylearn import CityLearnEnv

env = CityLearnEnv(
    "citylearn_challenge_2022_phase_all_plus_evs",
    episode_time_steps=24,
    interface="flat",
    render_mode="none",
)
agent = BusinessAsUsualAgent(env)
observations, info = env.reset(seed=0)
terminated = truncated = False

while not (terminated or truncated):
    actions = agent.predict(observations)
    observations, rewards, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(actions)

kpis = env.evaluate_v2()
selected = [
    "district_cost_total_control_eur",
    "district_energy_grid_total_import_control_kwh",
    "district_ev_performance_departure_min_acceptable_feasible_ratio",
    "district_electrical_service_phase_violations_energy_total_kwh",
]
print(kpis.loc[
    (kpis["level"] == "district") & kpis["cost_function"].isin(selected),
    ["cost_function", "value"],
].to_string(index=False))
env.close()
```
