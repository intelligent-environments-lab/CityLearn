# KPIs Reference

The simulator exposes two KPI APIs.

Portuguese version: [pt/kpis_reference.md](pt/kpis_reference.md).

| API | Status | Format | Recommended use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `evaluate()` | legacy | DataFrame with historical cost-function names | Compatibility with older workflows. |
| `evaluate_v2()` | primary | DataFrame with structured KPI names | Production, dashboards and scientific comparison. |

For the full v2 naming tree, see [KPI_V2_TREE.md](KPI_V2_TREE.md).

## Units

| Unit suffix | Meaning |

| `eur` | Monetary cost. If the dataset uses another currency, interpret as dataset currency. |
| `kwh` | Accumulated energy. |
| `kgco2` | Accumulated emissions. |
| `kw` | Power. |
| `ratio` | Dimensionless ratio. |
| `percent` | Percentage. |

## KPI v2 Naming Contract

```text
level_family_subfamily_metric_variant_unit
```

| Part | Examples |
|---|---|
| `level` | `building`, `district`. |
| `family` | `cost`, `energy_grid`, `emissions`, `solar_self_consumption`, `ev`, `battery`, `electrical_service_phase`, `equity`, `comfort_resilience`, `deferrable_appliance`, `escalator`, `demand_response`, `robustness`. |
| `subfamily` | `total`, `daily_average`, `ratio_to_baseline`, `ratio_to_business_as_usual`, `shape_quality`, `service`. |
| `metric` | `import`, `export`, `charge`, `completed_cycles`. |
| `variant` | `control`, `baseline`, `business_as_usual`, `delta`, `delta_to_business_as_usual`, `total`, `average`, `l1`. |
| `unit` | `eur`, `kwh`, `ratio`, etc. |

Examples:

| KPI | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `district_cost_total_control_eur` | Total control cost. |
| `district_cost_total_business_as_usual_eur` | Total native business-as-usual baseline cost. |
| `building_energy_grid_total_import_control_kwh` | Building import energy. |

| `district_demand_response_compliance_ratio` | Credited DR delivery divided by valid requested energy. |
| `district_robustness_action_dropout_count` | Number of action dropouts applied by robustness events. |

## Core Equations

For net energy `net_t`, where import is positive and export is negative:

```text
total_import_kwh = sum(max(net_t, 0))
total_export_kwh = sum(max(-net_t, 0))
total_net_exchange_kwh = sum(net_t)
daily_average_x = total_x / simulated_days
delta_x = control_x - baseline_x
ratio_to_baseline_x = control_x / baseline_x
delta_to_business_as_usual_x = control_x - business_as_usual_x
ratio_to_business_as_usual_x = control_x / business_as_usual_x
self_consumption = (solar_generation_total - export_total) / solar_generation_total
```

Safe division returns `None` or a safe placeholder when the denominator is not physically meaningful.

## KPI Families

## EV KPIs

| Concept | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| departure count | count | Number of EV departures observed. |
| departure met count | count | Departures where required SOC was met. |
| departure minimum acceptable count | count | Departures where SOC is at least `target_soc - ev_departure_service_tolerance`. |
| departure within tolerance count | count | Departures within the configured symmetric target tolerance. |
| departure target feasible/infeasible count | count | Departures where the strict target SOC was/was not reachable by charging at max power for the connected interval, after charger/battery efficiency and configured electrical-service headroom. |
| departure minimum acceptable feasible/infeasible count | count | Departures where the minimum acceptable SOC was/was not reachable under the same max-power, efficiency and electrical-service constraints. |
| departure within tolerance feasible/infeasible count | count | Departures where the lower bound of the symmetric tolerance band was/was not reachable under the same max-power, efficiency and electrical-service constraints. |
| departure success ratio | ratio | `met / departures`. |
| departure minimum acceptable ratio | ratio | `minimum_acceptable / departures`. This is the main user-service comfort KPI. |
| departure within tolerance ratio | ratio | `within_symmetric_tolerance / departures`. |
| departure success feasible ratio | ratio | Strict target fulfillment over feasible strict-target departures only. |
| departure minimum acceptable feasible ratio | ratio | Minimum service fulfillment over feasible minimum-service departures only. This is the main controller-quality KPI. |
| departure within tolerance feasible ratio | ratio | Symmetric target accuracy over feasible within-tolerance departures only. |
| departure SOC deficit mean | ratio | Mean non-negative SOC deficit over departures. |
| departure shortfall beyond tolerance mean | ratio | Mean deficit below `target_soc - ev_departure_service_tolerance`. |
| departure SOC surplus mean | ratio | Mean non-negative SOC surplus over departures. |
| departure SOC absolute error mean | ratio | Mean absolute SOC error to the requested target. |
| departure tolerance | ratio | Configured service tolerance used for minimum acceptable departure SOC. |
| charge total | kWh | Energy charged into EVs. |
| V2G export total | kWh | Energy exported by EVs. |

EV departure tolerance semantics:

- `ev_departure_success_rate` is strict target fulfillment: `actual_soc >= target_soc`.
- `ev_departure_min_acceptable_rate` is minimum service fulfillment: `actual_soc >= target_soc - ev_departure_service_tolerance`.
- `ev_departure_within_tolerance_rate` is symmetric target accuracy: `abs(actual_soc - target_soc) <= ev_departure_within_tolerance`.
- The `*_feasible_rate` variants use the same numerators but exclude departures where that threshold was not physically reachable from arrival SOC by charging at maximum charger/battery power for the connected interval, capped by configured building/phase import headroom and charger/battery efficiency.
- Feasibility counters are scenario-quality diagnostics; missing charger, battery or arrival-SOC data is treated as feasible to preserve legacy dataset behavior.
- Both tolerance settings default to `0.05`.
