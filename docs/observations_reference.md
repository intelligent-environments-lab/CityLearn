### `deferrable_appliance`

Base deferrable features are in `entity_base`; see the flat deferrable table above for definitions. Entity deferrables also include `remaining_duration_hours`, `cycle_remaining_fraction_ratio`, `hours_until_earliest_start`, `start_window_width_hours`, `start_energy_kwh_step`, `start_power_kw` and `must_start_now` for RL deadline pressure.

Derived forecasts default to future dataset values for backward compatibility
(`load_pv_method = "actual_future"`). A schema can instead set
`derived_forecasts.load_pv_method = "daily_persistence"`; load and PV then use
only the corresponding previous-day observation, with a current-step cold
start. Price respects the declared day-ahead publication boundary: realised
OMIE values are exposed only after publication and otherwise use the schema's
causal fallback (daily persistence in the annual REC suite). The exact sources
are exposed in `meta.forecast_config`; real-world adapters should populate
equivalent fields from operational forecasts.
