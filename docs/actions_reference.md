# Actions Reference

Actions are normalized for the agent. The simulator converts them to physical power or energy using capacity, nominal power, asset limits and `seconds_per_time_step`.

Portuguese version: [pt/actions_reference.md](pt/actions_reference.md).

## General Contract

| Rule | Contract |
|---|---|
| Bounds | Read from `env.action_space` and `env.action_names`. |
| Storage actions | Positive charges, negative discharges. |
| EV charger actions | Positive charges the EV, negative discharges/V2G if enabled. |
| Deferrable actions | Binary start command. `action > trigger_threshold` attempts to start the next pending cycle (`trigger_threshold` default: `0.5`). |
| Escalator actions | Three states: standby (`[0, 1/3[`), slow (`[1/3, 2/3[`) and normal (`[2/3, 1]`). |
| Internal energy | Applied step energy is `kWh/step`. |
| Power limits | Device ratings and service limits are `kW`. |
| Constraints | Charging/electrical service constraints may clip actions before application. |

## Flat Actions

| Action | Typical range | Entity | Effect |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `cooling_or_heating_device` | `[-1, 1]` | building | Negative controls cooling, positive controls heating. Mutually exclusive with separate cooling/heating actions. |
| `cooling_device` | `[0, 1]` | building | Controls cooling demand/setpoint in dynamic buildings. |
| `heating_device` | `[0, 1]` | building | Controls heating demand/setpoint in dynamic buildings. |
| `cooling_storage` | `[-limit, limit]` | building | Charge/discharge cooling thermal storage. |
| `heating_storage` | `[-limit, limit]` | building | Charge/discharge heating thermal storage. |
| `dhw_storage` | `[-limit, limit]` | building | Charge/discharge domestic hot water storage. |
| `electrical_storage` | `[-1, 1]` | building | Controls the building BESS. |
| `electric_vehicle_storage_{charger_id}` | `[-1, 1]` or `[0, 1]` | charger | Controls the EV connected to a charger. Negative bound depends on `max_discharging_power`. |
| `deferrable_appliance_{appliance_id}` | `[0, 1]` | appliance | Binary start command (`0` off, `1` on) for the next feasible cycle. |
| `escalator_{escalator_id}` | `[0, 1]` | escalator | Selects standby, slow or normal operation. |

## Physical Conversion

BESS action:

```text
energy_kwh_step = action * nominal_power_kw * seconds_per_time_step / 3600
```

EV charger action:

```text
charge_energy_kwh_step = positive_action * max_charging_power_kw * seconds_per_time_step / 3600
discharge_energy_kwh_step = negative_action * max_discharging_power_kw * seconds_per_time_step / 3600
```

After conversion, the asset applies SOC, capacity, efficiency, power curves and service constraints.

## Deferrable Appliance Start Logic

A cycle starts only when all conditions hold:

| Condition | Rule |
|---|---|
| Pending cycle | A cycle with state `pending` exists. |
| Action threshold | `action > trigger_threshold` (default `0.5`). |
| Start window | `earliest_start_time_step <= current_global_time_step <= latest_start_time_step`. |
| Deadline | `current + duration_steps - 1 <= deadline_time_step`. |
| Episode window | The full cycle fits inside the current episode. |

If the agent tries too late, the start is rejected. If `latest_start_time_step` passes with no valid start, the cycle is marked as missed.

Controller recommendation: use `deferrable_appliance_can_start` as the readiness signal and emit `1.0` only when a start is intended.

## Escalator Control

An escalator action is continuous only for agent compatibility; it is discretized
into three operating states. `standby` consumes standby power and leaves any
passenger demand above `service_threshold_passengers` unserved. Both `slow` and
`normal` serve aggregate demand. `available=0` forces standby. This model does
not simulate passenger queues or capacity limits.

## Entity Actions

| Table | Feature | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| `building` | building action names | `cooling_storage`, `dhw_storage`, `electrical_storage`, etc. |
| `charger` | `electric_vehicle_storage` | One row per active charger. |
| `deferrable_appliance` | `start` | One row per active appliance. |

Table payload:

```python
actions = {
    "tables": {
        "building": [[0.0, 0.2, -0.1]],
        "charger": [[1.0], [0.0]],
        "deferrable_appliance": [[1.0]]
    }
}
```

Map payload:

```python
actions = {
    "map": {
        "building:Building_1": {"electrical_storage": 0.1},
        "charger:Building_1:AC001": {"electric_vehicle_storage": 0.7},
        "deferrable_appliance:Building_1:washer_1": {"start": 1.0}
    }
}
```

## Step Ordering

The simplified building action order is:

1. Resolve active/inactive actions.
2. Apply charging/electrical constraints to EVs and BESS.
3. Update dynamic demands when applicable.
4. Update HVAC devices and thermal storage.
5. Update non-shiftable load.
6. Update BESS.
7. Update EV chargers.
8. Update deferrable appliances.
9. Update escalators.
10. Update net balance, rewards, KPIs and observations.

When `electrical_storage_action < 0`, BESS discharge is prioritized before other electrical consumption.
