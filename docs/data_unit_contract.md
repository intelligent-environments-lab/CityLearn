# Data Unit Contract

This document fixes the unit contract expected by the simulator. The goal is to avoid ambiguity when using hourly datasets, sub-hourly datasets or real data that originally arrives as power.

Portuguese version: [pt/data_unit_contract.md](pt/data_unit_contract.md).

## Base Rule

The physical engine accounts for energy per simulation step.

| Quantity | Unit |
|---|---|
| Time-series energy columns | `kWh/step` |
| Nominal power, limits, contracts and physical power actions | `kW` |
| Storage capacity | `kWh` |
| State of charge (`soc`) | fraction in `[0, 1]` |
| Energy prices | currency per `kWh` |
| Carbon intensity | CO2 mass per `kWh` |

`seconds_per_time_step` in the schema must represent the physical cadence of the dataset. If the dataset resolution and schema resolution differ, the simulator applies the compatibility conversion and prints an explicit `[CityLearn][unit-conversion]` warning. This is supported, but the preferred production path is to generate the dataset at the same resolution declared by the schema.

## Main Time Series

| Field | Unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `energy_simulation.non_shiftable_load` | `kWh/step` | Energy consumed in the step. |
| `energy_simulation.cooling_demand` | `kWh/step` | Thermal demand in the step. |
| `energy_simulation.heating_demand` | `kWh/step` | Thermal demand in the step. |
| `energy_simulation.dhw_demand` | `kWh/step` | Thermal demand in the step. |
| `energy_simulation.solar_generation` | PV profile per installed kW or `kWh/step` | Depends on `pv.attributes.generation_mode`; see PV section. |
| `pricing.electricity_pricing` | currency/`kWh` | Not scaled by step size. |
| `carbon_intensity.carbon_intensity` | CO2/`kWh` | Not scaled by step size. |
| `weather` | physical unit of each variable | Temperature, irradiance and humidity are not energy. |

## Equipment

| Element | Typical field | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| Battery / electrical storage | `capacity` | `kWh` |
| Battery / electrical storage | `nominal_power` | `kW` |
| Thermal storage | `capacity` | `kWh` |
| Thermal storage | `max_input_power`, `max_output_power` | `kW` |
| Heat pumps, heaters, chillers | `nominal_power` | electrical `kW` |
| PV | `nominal_power` | `kW` |
| EV charger | `max_charging_power`, `max_discharging_power` | `kW` |
| Electric vehicle | battery `capacity` | `kWh` |
| Deferrable appliance | cycle `load_profile` | `kWh/step` |
| Deferrable appliance | cycle `total_energy_kwh` | `kWh` |
| Grid/phase/contract limits | power limits | `kW` |

Any `kW` limit is converted to step energy with:

```text
max_energy_kwh_step = limit_kw * seconds_per_time_step / 3600
```

## Real Data Conversion

When the real source arrives as power, the converter must produce energy columns in `kWh/step` before generating the CityLearn dataset.

```text
energy_kwh_step = mean_power_kw_over_step * seconds_per_time_step / 3600
```

Practical rules:

| Source | Conversion |
|---|---|
| Power series in `kW` | Aggregate to simulator cadence with time mean, then convert to `kWh/step`. |
| Interval readings already in `kWh` | Sum intervals belonging to the simulation step. |
| Cumulative `kWh` meters | Difference consecutive readings, then aggregate. |
| Prices and emissions | Align or forward-fill to simulator cadence; do not multiply by step size. |
| Phase limits, contracted power and device ratings | Keep in `kW`. |
| EV timestamps | Convert absolute times to integer timesteps used by charger schedules. |
| Deferrable timestamps | Use global dataset timesteps for `earliest_start_time_step`, `latest_start_time_step` and `deadline_time_step`. |
| EV charger countdowns | `electric_vehicle_departure_time` and `electric_vehicle_estimated_arrival_time` are step counts, not clock hours. |
| Entity derived forecasts | Computed from future dataset values in simulator time, with horizons converted from seconds using `seconds_per_time_step`. |
| Entity action feedback | Requested/limited actions are normalized commands; requested/limited/applied power fields are `kW`; short-window energy fields are `kWh`. |
| Entity BESS energy capacity | `max_*_energy_kwh_step` is nominal power converted by step duration; `available_*_energy_kwh_step` is the constrained SOC/headroom/outage capacity for the same step. |
| Sub-minute datasets | Include optional `seconds` in `energy_simulation` whenever possible. |
| Quality flags like `generated` | Keep them in the ingestion/conversion pipeline; they are not native physical CityLearn fields. |

Example:

```text
load_kw = 55.0
seconds_per_time_step = 15
load_kwh_step = 55.0 * 15 / 3600 = 0.2291667
```

Small `kWh/step` values are physically correct at 15s. If an agent needs `kW` or normalized values, convert in the agent observation layer, not in the internal energy balance.

## Formats and Loading

Time-series files referenced by the schema may be CSV (`.csv`) or Parquet (`.parquet`, `.pq`, `.parq`). The column and unit contract is identical in both formats.

The loader reads only the window declared by `simulation_start_time_step` and `simulation_end_time_step`, while preserving the original offset so rolling or non-zero episodes stay aligned with global dataset indices.

For large datasets, especially full-year 15s data, Parquet is usually better than CSV because it preserves types, compresses better and avoids text parsing. Parquet support requires `pyarrow`; without it, use CSV.

When several buildings point to the same `weather`, `pricing` or `carbon_intensity` file and `noise_std = 0`, the simulator shares the same in-memory time series. `energy_simulation` remains building-specific.

## Deferrable Appliances

The official format for deferrable loads uses two files per appliance:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cycle_profiles_file` | Physical cycle profile catalog. |
| `flexibility_schedule_file` | Flexibility requests pointing to catalog entries through `profile_id`. |

`cycle_profiles_file`:

| Field | Unit/type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `profile_id` | identifier | Stable physical profile key. |
| `duration_steps` | steps | Must match `load_profile` length. |
| `total_energy_kwh` | `kWh` | Must match `sum(load_profile)`. |
| `load_profile` | list of `kWh/step` | Energy consumed at each cycle step. |

`flexibility_schedule_file`:

| Field | Unit/type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cycle_id` | identifier | Unique request/occurrence. |
| `profile_id` | identifier | Reference to the catalog. |
| `earliest_start_time_step` | global timestep | First timestep where the cycle may start. |
| `latest_start_time_step` | global timestep | Last timestep where the agent may start. |
| `deadline_time_step` | global timestep | Last timestep by which the cycle must be complete. |
| `priority` | ratio `[0, 1]` | External request priority/urgency. |
| `must_run` | bool | Service contract flag. |

The RL action is simple: `start`. If the action exceeds the threshold, the simulator tries to start the next pending cycle. The cycle starts only inside `[earliest_start_time_step, latest_start_time_step]` and only if it fits before `deadline_time_step`. If `latest_start_time_step` passes without a valid start, the cycle is marked missed.

If real cycle data arrives as power (`kW`), the converter must generate `load_profile` as energy:

```text
cycle_step_kwh = cycle_step_kw * seconds_per_time_step / 3600
```

Do not repeat `load_profile` per timestep in the dataset. Temporal repetition belongs in `flexibility_schedule_file`, pointing to the same `profile_id`.

## EV Flexibility Features

In the entity interface, EV flexibility should preferably be consumed through physical/normalized derived features:

| Feature | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `hours_until_departure` | Physical time until departure. |
| `time_until_departure_ratio` | `hours_until_departure / 24`, clipped to `[0, 1]`. |
| `energy_to_required_soc_kwh` | Energy still required to reach target SOC. |
| `required_average_power_kw` | Average power required until departure. |
| `charging_slack_kw` | Margin between charger max power and required average power. |
| `charging_priority_ratio` | Urgency in `[0, 1]`, derived from required average power versus charger max power. |
| `max_deliverable_energy_until_departure_kwh` | Energy that can still be delivered by departure under current feasible charge power. |
| `departure_energy_margin_kwh` | `max_deliverable_energy_until_departure_kwh - energy_to_required_soc_kwh`; negative means the target is currently infeasible. |
| `departure_feasibility_ratio` | `energy_to_required_soc_kwh / max_deliverable_energy_until_departure_kwh`; values above `1` indicate infeasibility under current limits. |
| `min_required_action_normalized` | Required average charger power divided by charger max charging power; values above `1` indicate a power deadline conflict. |

## PV

`energy_simulation.solar_generation` is the easiest field to misinterpret. The simulator reads this field from the dataset. For compatibility with original CityLearn, the default mode treats it as generation profile per `1 kW` of installed PV and multiplies by `pv.nominal_power`.

Default `per_kw` mode:

```text
pv_generation_kwh_step = pv.nominal_power_kw * solar_generation / 1000
```

For real absolute data, declare:

```json
"pv": {
  "type": "citylearn.energy_model.PV",
  "autosize": false,
  "attributes": {
    "nominal_power": 120.0,
    "generation_mode": "absolute"
  }
}
```

With `generation_mode = "absolute"`, `energy_simulation.solar_generation` is interpreted directly as real PV energy in `kWh/step`:

```text
pv_generation_kwh_step = solar_generation
```

In absolute mode, `pv.nominal_power` remains useful as installed power or physical rating in `kW`, but it no longer scales the dataset series.
